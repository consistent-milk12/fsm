# Log Analysis and Resolution Report

This document summarizes the logical inconsistencies and bugs identified during the analysis of the `logs/fsm-core.tsv` file and the actions taken to resolve them.

## 1. TSV Integrity Issues

*   **Observation:** Multiple rows in `fsm-core.tsv` contained only 1 field, instead of the expected 14 fields.
*   **Impact:** This indicated a fundamental problem with the logging mechanism, leading to corrupted or incomplete log entries.
*   **Status: Resolved**
*   **Action Taken:** Unstructured `info!`, `debug!`, `warn!`, and `error!` calls were replaced with structured logging within `#[instrument]` spans. The use of `#[instrument(err)]` now ensures that both success and error cases are captured with the full context, maintaining TSV integrity.

## 2. Navigation Flow Inconsistency (`ENTER` events)

*   **Observation:** `ENTER_COMPLETE` events were logged without corresponding `ENTER_START` events.
*   **Impact:** This made it difficult to trace the full lifecycle of directory navigations.
*   **Status: Resolved**
*   **Action Taken:** The `navigate_to` function in `fsm-core/src/controller/action_dispatcher/fs_dispatcher.rs` was refactored to use a single `#[instrument]` span. The `marker` field is now updated to `ENTER_COMPLETE` within the same span, ensuring a single, coherent log entry for each navigation event.

## 3. UI Rendering Flow Inconsistency

*   **Observation:** The count of `UI_RENDER_COMPLETE` events significantly exceeded that of `UI_RENDER_START` events.
*   **Impact:** This made it challenging to track the beginning of all UI rendering operations.
*   **Status: Resolved**
*   **Action Taken:** The `render_frame` function in `fsm-core/src/main.rs` was refactored. An early return now logs a `UI_FRAME_SKIPPED` event, preventing a `UI_RENDER_START` from being logged without a corresponding `UI_RENDER_COMPLETE`. The core rendering logic was moved to an instrumented helper function, which correctly updates the span marker to `UI_RENDER_COMPLETE`.

## 4. ObjectTable Rendering Issue

*   **Observation:** The "Size" and "Count" columns in the `ObjectTable` were not displaying correctly for directories. The size was shown as "x items" and the count was "-".
*   **Impact:** The UI did not provide accurate size and item count information for directories, diminishing the tool's utility.
*   **Status: Resolved**
*   **Action Taken:**
    1.  The `from_light_info` function in `fsm-core/src/fs/object_info.rs` was modified to correctly calculate the total size of a directory by summing the sizes of its entries.
    2.  The rendering logic in `fsm-core/src/view/components/object_table.rs` was updated to display the human-readable size in the "Size" column and the `items_count` in the "Count" column for directories.

## 5. UI Performance Bottlenecks

*   **Observation:** Four instances of `UI_RENDER_SLOW` events were identified in the initial log file.
*   **Impact:** These events highlight occurrences where UI rendering performance fell below acceptable thresholds.
*   **Status: No Action Taken**
*   **Action Taken:** This item was not addressed as it falls outside the scope of fixing logging and rendering logic. Further analysis on new logs is required.

---

**Recommendations:**

*   **Generate New Logs:** Generate a new `fsm-core.tsv` log file to verify that all fixes are working as expected.
*   **Verify UI:** Confirm that the `ObjectTable` now correctly displays the size and item count for directories.
*   **Analyze `UI_RENDER_SLOW` Events:** Examine the specific context of any `UI_RENDER_SLOW` events in the new log file to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
