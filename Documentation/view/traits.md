# Traits Module Documentation

## Overview
The `traits` module defines common traits for UI components, particularly overlays and modals, to ensure consistent behavior and interaction patterns across the TUI.

## Features
- `Overlay`: Trait for modal/overlay components (rendering, input handling, stacking)
- `Focusable`: Trait for components that can be focused/unfocused
- `Scrollable`: Trait for components with scrollable content

## Usage
- Implement these traits for custom overlays, modals, or UI components to integrate with the application's UI system
