# Controller Traits (`src/controller/traits.rs`)

This file is reserved for controller-related traits and interfaces that define contracts for event handling, action dispatch, or controller extensibility.

## Current Status
Currently empty, but intended for future expansion. Possible uses include:
- Defining a trait for custom action handlers or controller plugins.
- Abstracting over different event loop implementations.
- Providing testable interfaces for controller logic.

## Usage
Add traits here as the controller layer grows in complexity or needs to support plugins, testing, or alternative event loop strategies.
