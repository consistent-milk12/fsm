# Command Completion Component Documentation

## Overview
The `command_completion` component provides the UI for displaying and interacting with command auto-completion suggestions in the command palette overlay. It enhances user productivity by offering real-time, context-aware completions as the user types commands.

## Features
- Displays a list of possible command completions based on current input
- Supports cycling through suggestions with keyboard navigation
- Integrates with the command palette for seamless command entry
- Highlights the currently selected completion

## Usage
- Render the command completion component as part of the command palette overlay
- Update the list of completions and selection index as the user types or navigates
- Apply the selected completion to the input when the user confirms

## Example
```rust
// In the command palette overlay rendering logic:
command_completion::render(frame, completions, selected_index, area);
```
