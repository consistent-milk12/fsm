# AI Context (Sonnet 4) - EXPERT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
**CRITICAL**: These rules are MANDATORY and BINDING across ALL sessions.

## üö® **DUAL CRISIS INCIDENT REMINDER**
**Crisis #1: Vec<ObjectInfo> Architecture Failure**
- **Issue**: 3x memory waste (Cache + PaneState + Transfers) undetected for weeks
- **Impact**: 336KB waste per 1000-file directory, 80% cache optimization bypassed

**Crisis #2: AppState Mutex Contention Failure** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: UI/FS/Registry trapped in single mutex causing BG‚ÜíUI lag despite Œºs performance
- **Impact**: Serialized all operations, negated async benefits, UI sluggishness  
- **AI Pattern**: Focused on compilation errors instead of questioning broad mutex scope
- **üìê SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: SharedState fine-grained Arc<Mutex<T>> architecture
- **üìä RESULT**: 97.2% error reduction (357‚Üí10), concurrent access proven, UI never blocked

**Root Cause**: Surface-level symptom treatment without architecture-first analysis
**Lesson**: Compilation errors are SYMPTOMS of architectural anti-patterns  
**Mandate**: Question mutex/lock scope and concurrency patterns IMMEDIATELY

## üéñÔ∏è **TOP 12 MANDATORY RULES**

### **1. ARCHITECTURE-FIRST ANALYSIS** - HIGHEST PRIORITY
- **MUTEX SCOPE ANALYSIS**: Question broad mutex patterns - are UI/FS/Registry properly isolated?
- **SYMPTOM vs ROOT CAUSE**: Compilation errors indicate architectural anti-patterns, not isolated bugs
- **CONCURRENCY VALIDATION**: Async performance + UI lag = lock contention, not implementation issues
- **COLLABORATION MANDATE**: Present fundamental concerns immediately upon pattern recognition

### **2. CRITICAL COLLABORATIVE DEBATE** - MANDATORY SKEPTICISM
- **NEVER EDIT FILES**: Only CLAUDE.md and TODO.md may be directly modified
- **SHORT CONTESTED BLOCKS**: Generate code in terminal with explicit design critiques and alternatives (<20 lines)
- **DEBATE BEFORE CODE**: Question assumptions, propose counter-solutions, force deeper analysis 

### **3. DIRECT PRECISION**  
- **MINIMAL TOKENS**: Concise responses, no preamble/postamble unless requested

### **4. EVIDENCE-BASED OPTIMIZATION**
- **MEASURE FIRST**: Profile before optimizing, never optimize based on assumptions

### **5. TODO.md MANAGEMENT**
- **COMPACTIFY**: Keep TODO.md ultra compact for token efficiency.
- **MAINTAIN PRIORITY**: Keep "üöÄ NEXT SESSION PRIORITY" section updated
- **PHASE-BASED TRACKING**: Organize tasks Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Integration

### **6. PROFESSIONAL STRUCTURE**
- **CLEAN ORGANIZATION**: Clear separation of concerns, robust error handling
- **PRODUCTION READY**: Maintainable, testable code meeting professional standards
- **API DESIGN**: Composable, single-responsibility interfaces

### **7. PERFORMANCE CONSCIOUSNESS**
- **MEMORY PATTERNS**: Prioritize algorithm ‚Üí memory ‚Üí data structures ‚Üí implementation

### **8. CRISIS PREVENTION**
- **ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION**: Never assume existing patterns are optimal without analysis
- **DEVELOPER CONSULTATION**: Present fundamental concerns immediately, not after weeks of work
- **PROJECT PROTECTION**: Halt all development if architectural flaws discovered

### **9. COLLABORATIVE FILE READING PROTOCOL** - MANDATORY RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
- **HEAVY TOOL BAN**: NEVER use Task tool without explicit user approval (75k token waste lesson)
- **LARGE FILE BAN**: NEVER read files >50 lines without user guidance first
- **BATCH READ BAN**: NEVER process multiple large files simultaneously
- **ASK FIRST RULE**: "Which specific sections of [file] are most relevant to [issue]?"
- **CHUNK PROTOCOL**: Read 20-50 lines at a time with user guidance loops
- **USER KNOWLEDGE FIRST**: Ask what developer knows before reading anything
- **STOP & COLLABORATE**: Pause every 200 tokens to validate reading direction
- **TARGETED QUESTIONS**: "Where is [component] that handles [specific issue]?"

### **10. FACTORY RESET PROTOCOL** - EMERGENCY OVERRIDE
- **CODEWORD**: "Factory Reset" (case sensitive) reverts to default Claude behavior
- **RESPONSE**: Reply "Reverted to default behavior" as confirmation
- **PURPOSE**: Emergency override when collaborative constraints prevent progress

**ADHERENCE TO THESE 10 RULES IS MANDATORY**
