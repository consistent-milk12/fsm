# Next Phase Selection

**READY FOR:** Next major feature implementation

## 1. Executive Summary
**Objective:** Enable user-initiated cancellation of file operations via ESC key  
**Priority:** High (essential UX for long-running operations)  
**Complexity:** Medium (key handling + cancellation token cleanup)  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2.3 FileOperationsOverlay (✅ Complete)  
**Estimated Effort:** 1 development session  

## 2. Context & Background
**Problem:** Users cannot cancel long-running file operations once started  
**Current State:** CancellationToken integrated but no user-facing cancellation trigger  
**Required:** ESC key handling + proper cleanup of cancelled operations  
**Integration Point:** Event loop key handling + UIState operation management  

## 3. Success Criteria
### Must Have (P0)
- [ ] **ESC Key Detection**: Detect ESC key during active file operations
- [ ] **Token Cancellation**: Cancel active operations via CancellationToken
- [ ] **UI Cleanup**: Remove cancelled operations from active_file_operations HashMap  
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Show cancellation confirmation message
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Handle partial operation completion properly

### Should Have (P1)
- [ ] **Multi-operation Cancel**: Cancel all active operations with single ESC press
- [ ] **Cancel Confirmation**: Brief notification confirming cancellation
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of temporary files/handles
- [ ] **Progress Preservation**: Don't lose completed work before cancellation

### Could Have (P2)
- [ ] **Selective Cancellation**: Choose which operation to cancel (future enhancement)
- [ ] **Cancel with Confirmation**: Optional confirmation dialog before cancellation

## 4. Technical Approach
**Architecture:** Event loop key handling with cancellation token integration  
**Data Flow:** ESC key → event_loop → cancel tokens → cleanup UIState  
**Performance:** Minimal overhead, only active during operations  
**Error Handling:** Robust cleanup even if cancellation fails

## Implementation Specification

### 1. Cancellation Token Management
```rust
// src/model/ui_state.rs - Add cancellation token tracking
use tokio_util::CancellationToken;

#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct UIState {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    /// Track cancellation tokens for active operations
    pub operation_cancel_tokens: HashMap<String, CancellationToken>,
}

impl UIState {
    /// Store cancellation token for operation
    pub fn store_cancel_token(&mut self, operation_id: String, token: CancellationToken) {
        self.operation_cancel_tokens.insert(operation_id, token);
    }
    
    /// Cancel all active file operations
    pub fn cancel_all_operations(&mut self) -> usize {
        let count = self.operation_cancel_tokens.len();
        
        // Cancel all tokens
        for token in self.operation_cancel_tokens.values() {
            token.cancel();
        }
        
        // Clear tracking data
        self.operation_cancel_tokens.clear();
        self.active_file_operations.clear();
        
        count
    }
    
    /// Remove completed/cancelled operation
    pub fn remove_operation(&mut self, operation_id: &str) {
        self.operation_cancel_tokens.remove(operation_id);
        self.active_file_operations.remove(operation_id);
    }
}
```

### 2. Event Loop ESC Key Handling
```rust
// src/controller/event_loop.rs - Add ESC key cancellation
use crossterm::event::{KeyCode, KeyEvent};

impl EventLoop {
    async fn handle_key_event(&mut self, key: KeyEvent) -> Result<(), AppError> {
        // ESC key handling - highest priority for operation cancellation
        if key.code == KeyCode::Esc {
            return self.handle_escape_key().await;
        }
        
        // ... existing key handling ...
    }
    
    async fn handle_escape_key(&mut self) -> Result<(), AppError> {
        let mut app = self.app.lock().await;
        
        // Cancel file operations if any are active
        if !app.ui.active_file_operations.is_empty() {
            let cancelled_count = app.ui.cancel_all_operations();
            
            if cancelled_count > 0 {
                app.ui.show_info(format!("Cancelled {} file operation(s)", cancelled_count));
                tracing::info!("User cancelled {} file operations via ESC key", cancelled_count);
                return Ok(());
            }
        }
        
        // Handle other overlay closures
        match app.ui.overlay {
            UIOverlay::Help | UIOverlay::Search | UIOverlay::FileNameSearch 
            | UIOverlay::ContentSearch | UIOverlay::SearchResults 
            | UIOverlay::Prompt => {
                app.ui.close_all_overlays();
            }
            _ => {
                // ESC in browse mode - could add additional behavior here
            }
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### 3. File Operation Task Integration
```rust
// src/tasks/file_ops_task.rs - Integrate token storage
impl FileOperationTask {
    pub async fn execute(mut self) -> Result<(), AppError> {
        let operation_id = self.operation_id.clone();
        let cancel_token = self.cancel_token.clone();
        
        // Store cancellation token in UI state for ESC key access
        {
            let app = self.app.lock().await;
            app.ui.store_cancel_token(operation_id.clone(), cancel_token.clone());
        }
        
        // ... existing task execution logic ...
        
        // Cleanup on completion or error
        let app = self.app.lock().await;
        app.ui.remove_operation(&operation_id);
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Task Result Handling
```rust
// src/controller/event_loop.rs - Handle cancellation in task results
async fn handle_task_result(&mut self, result: TaskResult) -> Result<(), AppError> {
    match result {
        TaskResult::FileOperationComplete { operation_id, result } => {
            let mut app = self.app.lock().await;
            
            // Remove from tracking regardless of success/failure
            app.ui.remove_operation(&operation_id);
            
            match result {
                Ok(()) => {
                    app.ui.show_success("File operation completed successfully");
                }
                Err(e) => {
                    // Check if error was due to cancellation
                    if e.to_string().contains("cancelled") || e.to_string().contains("canceled") {
                        // Don't show error for user-initiated cancellation
                        tracing::debug!("Operation {} was cancelled by user", operation_id);
                    } else {
                        app.ui.show_error(format!("File operation failed: {}", e));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        TaskResult::FileOperationProgress { operation_id, .. } => {
            // Progress updates don't need special cancellation handling
            // The cancellation will be handled by the task itself
        }
        // ... other task results ...
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **ESC Key Detection**: Detect ESC key during active file operations
- [ ] **Token Cancellation**: Cancel active operations via CancellationToken
- [ ] **UI Cleanup**: Remove cancelled operations from active_file_operations HashMap  
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Show cancellation confirmation message
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Handle partial operation completion properly
- [ ] **Multi-operation Cancel**: Cancel all active operations with single ESC press
- [ ] **Cancel Confirmation**: Brief notification confirming cancellation
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of temporary files/handles
- [ ] **Progress Preservation**: Don't lose completed work before cancellation

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, only active during operations
- **Memory**: Efficient HashMap cleanup of cancelled operations
- **Thread Safety**: Proper async/await handling during cancellation
- **Integration**: Seamless addition to existing event loop
- **Error Handling**: Robust cleanup even if cancellation fails

## Testing Approach
1. Start large file copy operation
2. Press ESC key during operation
3. Verify operation cancels and UI clears
4. Test with multiple concurrent operations
5. Confirm cancellation notification appears
6. Validate no resource leaks after cancellation

## 5. Testing Strategy
**Unit Tests:** Cancellation token behavior and UI state cleanup  
**Integration Tests:** Full ESC key → cancellation → UI update pipeline  
**Performance Tests:** Memory and resource usage during cancellation  
**User Acceptance:** Manual testing with various operation types  

## 6. Risk Assessment (Claude-Enhanced)
### High Risk (Project Impact)
- **Incomplete cancellation leaving zombie operations**
  - *Claude Analysis*: Partial cleanup could cause UI inconsistencies
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive cleanup in all code paths
  - *Detection*: Monitor active operations count after cancellation

### Medium Risk (User Experience)  
- **Cancellation not responsive during heavy I/O**
  - *Claude Analysis*: Long-running I/O operations may delay cancellation response
  - *Mitigation*: Check cancellation token in I/O loops
  - *Detection*: Manual testing with large file operations

### Low Risk (Edge Cases)
- **Race conditions between completion and cancellation**
  - *Claude Analysis*: Operation could complete just as user presses ESC
  - *Mitigation*: Proper synchronization and state checking
  - *Detection*: Stress testing with rapid operations

### Edge Cases (Claude-Identified)
- **ESC key conflict with other UI overlays**
- **Multiple rapid ESC key presses**
- **Cancellation during error conditions**
- **Network operations that can't be cancelled immediately**

## 7. Rollback Plan
**Failure Condition:** Cancellation causes crashes or incomplete cleanup  
**Rollback Steps:**
1. Remove ESC key cancellation handling
2. Revert UIState cancellation token methods
3. Remove operation cleanup from event loop
4. Operations continue without user cancellation option

## 8. Definition of Done (Claude-Enhanced)
### Code Quality
- [ ] All P0 success criteria met and tested
- [ ] Code passes cargo fmt + check + clippy + build
